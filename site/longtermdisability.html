    <h1>Texas Long Term Disability Claim Lawyer<br/>
        Texas Disability Insurance Attorney</h1>

    <h4>Are you unable to work due to a disability?</h4>
    
    Do you need to make a claim for disability benefits under an employer-provided disability 
    insurance policy?  Has the insurance company denied your claim or terminated your 
    disability benefits?<p/>

    Jessica Taylor helps people obtain the long-term disability benefits they 
    need and deserve.  Employer-provided disability benefits are protected 
    under a federal statute called the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).  
    The Law Office of Jessica Taylor is one of the few law firms in Texas that 
    focuses on ERISA claims.<p/>

    <h4>Denial of Long Term Disability Benefits</h4>

    If you become disabled you should file a <a href="claims.html">claim</a> for long-term 
    disability benefits through your employer-sponsored insurance program.  However, the 
    insurance company may attempt to deny benefits by claiming that you are not disabled 
    as defined by their policy.  <p/>

    The insurance company will have their physician look at your claim file to provide 
    evidence that you are able to perform your normal work duties.  They may even hire 
    private detectives to conduct surveillance of your activities. <p/>

    <h4>Jessica Taylor Will Stand Up for Your Rights</h4>

    Jessica Taylor will counter these strategies by presenting her 
    own compelling evidence on behalf of her clients. <p/>

    If your long term or short-term disability benefits are being denied, Ms. Taylor
    will argue that the insurance company made a mistake in denying your claim.  
    She will present medical evidence that shows you are being treated for 
    a long-term disability that prevents you from returning to work.  <p/>

    If the insurance company does not accept her arguments, Ms. Taylor will  
    <a href="erisa-appeal.html">appeal your claim</a> or 
    engage in <a href="erisa-litigation.html">ERISA litigation</a> to ensure you receive 
    the long-term disability benefits you need.  <p/>

    <h4>Jessica Taylor Understands How the Insurance Companies Handle Claims</h4>

    Jessica Taylor knows how the insurance companies operate because she 
    used to represent them when she worked for a large, multi-national law firm.   
    Having defended insurers who have denied claimants these benefits, she understands 
    insurers' claim management practices.  She knows how they evaluate and analyze claims, 
    and she will put that experience to work in your case. <p/>

    Whether you have been denied benefits, had benefits terminated, or have other short 
    or long term disability benefit issues, Ms. Taylor has the experience with insurance 
    claims and the law to assist you.  <p/>
