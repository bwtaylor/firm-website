    <td class="regular-content"><h1>Texas Long Term Disability Claims</h1>
    If you have been denied long-term disability benefits, The Law Office of Jessica Taylor 
    may be able to help you obtain those benefits.  Long-term disability benefits are usually 
    governed under a federal statute called ERISA (the Employee Retirement Income Security Act) 
    if you obtained those benefits from your employer.   The Law Offices of Jessica Taylor is 
    one of the few law firms in Texas that specializes in the area of ERISA litigation. <p/> 

    Attorney Jessica Taylor knows how the insurance companies operate because she used to 
    represent them when she worked for a large, international law firm.   Having defended 
    insurers who have denied claimants these benefits, she understands insurers’ claim 
    management practices.  She knows how they evaluate and analyze claims, and she will 
    put that experience to work in your case. <p/>

    Whether you have been denied benefits, had benefits terminated, or have other short or 
    long term disability benefit issues, Ms. Taylor has the experience with insurance claims 
    and the law to assist you.  Contact Ms. Taylor, an ERISA lawyer, for a free consultation today.  
    The Law Office of Jessica Taylor assists with a variety of needs relating to long term 
    disability, such as:
