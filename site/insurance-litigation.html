    <h1>San Antonio Insurance Claims Attorney<br/>
        San Antonio Insurance Bad Faith Attorney</h1>

    <h4>You Pay Premiums, You Have A Right To Fair Treatment</h4>

    You obtain insurance so you will be protected if something unexpected happens. You make 
    your premium payments on a timely basis, and you expect your insurance company to be 
    there for you and to treat your fairly and in good faith when things go wrong. If your 
    insurance company fails to provide you with the coverage or claims handling you deserve, 
    it is time to talk to an experienced lawyer who can protect your rights. At The Law Office 
    of Jessica Taylor, we protect the rights of individuals and businesses across Texas who have 
    been the victims of insurance companies who deny claims in bad faith.<p/>

    Whether you have individual disability insurance, life insurance, homeowners insurance, 
    auto insurance or property & casualty insurance, when you experience a loss and submit 
    your claim, your insurance company must handle your claim with good faith and 
    fair dealing. If your insurance company delays or denies your legitimate claim or refuses 
    to pay it in full for any reason, you have legal options. <p/>
    
    <h4>An Experienced Insurance Claims Lawyer Can Help</h4>

    You can file a bad faith insurance claim against your insurance company to enforce 
    your claim and receive compensation for your losses. Ms. Taylor will examine your 
    case and determine whether or not your insurance company has exercised  
    good faith and fair dealing. <p/>

    You may feel helpless against a large insurance company, but Ms. Taylor is an
    experienced litigator who is not afraid to aggressively challenge big insurance 
    companies. Ms. Taylor knows how insurance companies operate because she used to 
    represent them when she worked for a large, multi-national law firm.   Having defended 
    insurers, she understands claim management practices.  She knows how insurers 
    evaluate and analyze claims, and she will put that experience to work in your case. 
    Ms. Taylor knows how much you have at stake, and she will put her experience 
    and resources to work for you. <p/>

    <h4>Contact Us</h4>
    We will provide personal service and hands-on counsel from start to finish of your case 
    and be there for you every step of the way. The sooner you take action, the sooner 
    you can pursue the compensation and coverage you deserve for your losses.  We offer 
    a contingent fee option for these cases.  If you need quality legal representation,
